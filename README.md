Making an AI to play poker (Texas hold'em)

This project is a side project just for fun. 

Right now if you comment out test() and uncomment everything else under 'if __name__=="__main__":' this will play poker on the terminal. I know it's not optimal to play on the terminal since if players use a shared terminal they will know each other's hands.

# Features to be implemented
AI to play poker and train via neural networks

# Features to be debugged
tiebreakers and betting money using small and big blind
